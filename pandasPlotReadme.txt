OK, so if you type "python pandasPlot.py" at the prompt, then a window should
pop up with 3 buttons.  Each one of them makes a different type of graph from
the data file in the input directory.  (It is hard-coded to use the Tomcat.csv
file.)  I hard-coded which columns to use.  I don't really know what kind of
graphs we want to make with this data, so I just kind of randomly chose some
stuff.
