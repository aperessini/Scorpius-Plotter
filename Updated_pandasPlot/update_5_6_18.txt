Finally figured out the file chooser and screen manager capabilities with Kivy, 
so I took Cheryl's pandasPlot.py file and created pandasPlotFC.py with the file selection functionality.

The file still needs to be accompanied by an input directory for it to function properly. I will merge the python
code with Cheryl's original code once you both have checked it out.

Next step will be to use the get_headers code from the plotter file to get and display data headers,
then allow user to select options via GUI
